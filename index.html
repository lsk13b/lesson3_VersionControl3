            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. When you use version control you can go back to earlier files if you mess up and no damage would be done to your files. You can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores and thinks about information differently than other version control systems. The major difference between Git and any other VCS is the way Git thinks about its data. most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.  Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><p>
Perforce is a commercial, proprietary revision control system developed by Perforce Software. The Perforce server manages a central database and a master repository of file versions. It stores system-related metadata. Files are identified by namespace. File content itself is not stored in the database. Perforce system can make part or all of its content available as Git repositories. Git users can work with the same file content and history. Perforce tends to perform better on large repositories than Subversion. Perforce has four mechanisms for providing revision control to distributed or remote teams. The mechanisms can be used with one another or alone. They are: proxy server, remote depots, replication, can be replicated to Git repositories

</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">“Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale enterprise operations.” Subversion uses the inter-file branching model from Perforce[23] to implement branches and tagging. A branch is a separate line of development. Tagging refers to labeling the repository at a certain point in time so that it can be easily found in the future. In Subversion, the only difference between branches and tags is how they are used.
